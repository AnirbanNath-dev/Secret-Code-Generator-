# Secret-Code-Generator
This is a secret code generator created for fun during my free time. The code follows a specific rule:

- If the word is less than 4 letters, it reverses the word.
- If the word is greater than or equal to 4 letters, it removes the first letter from the word and adds it to the end.
- It also adds 3 random letters and numbers to the beginning and end of the word.


# Usage
To use the secret code generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the secretCodeGenerator.js file in a JavaScript environment.
3. Replace the text **This is a sample text** in __text variable__ with what you want to type.
4. The program will generate the secret code based on the rules mentioned above.
